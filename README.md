# Sprint #17 Practice Task 

Add to the Web application from the previous sprint a ***Security level***, 
which includes user **Authentication** and **Authorization**.

#### Implemented security level should include the next scenarios:

1. If the user has **not yet logged in**, then after visiting *any page* 
   **redirect** him **to the login page**, which is available at URL `/form-login`.  
   * The *login form* should include fields for entering **login** and **password**, and the **button “LogIn”**.  
   * As the **username** for login, use the ***user’s email***.
2. If the user entered the **invalid credentials**, then 
   **redirect** him back **to the login page** with *error information*.
3. If the user's **login and password entered correctly**, then 
   **allow him access** to web application ***according to his role***:
    * If the role of the user is **MENTOR**, then 
      allow him **full access** to all resources of the web application.
    * If the role of the user **TRAINEE**, then:
        * After going to the *`Marathons` page*, display for user the 
          list of marathons where he participates *without possibility of remove and edit* marathons.
        * When user *clicks on **marathon name*** instead of `Students` page, 
          *redirect* the user to the *`Sprints` page* for the selected marathon.
        * ***Prohibit*** for user viewing *list of student, adding, editing, and deleting students*.
        * ***Prohibit*** for user *create marathons and sprints*, and *adding and removing students from the marathon*.
        * In case of an ***attempt unauthorized access*** to forbidden URL, 
          *redirect* the user to the *`Access Denied` page* and *set the status code to 403*.
4. If the user **clicks the `LogOut`** button, then **end the user session** and redirect him to the **login page**.

##

For storing **user credentials** use `users` and `roles` tables from *database*.

The user **password** should be encoded using the ***BCrypt*** encryption algorithm.
